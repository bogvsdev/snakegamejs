JavaScript Snake Game

Snake game is like a helloworld to game development. So here is my hello to world.

Snake should eat red squares to become bigger and to earn scores. Blue square is a bonus which removes all walls around and gives you +2 score. More snake eats - bigger and faster it becomes. Walls are green, if snake crash the wall game is over. You should save your result and then game restarts.
